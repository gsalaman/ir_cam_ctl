# ir_cam_ctl
This repo contains JUST control code for the ir_cam application.

I'm putting this here so that I can download onto Mac, test the python with MQTT there, and then maybe even make a new python app that has GUI control.

## GUI notes
I'm playing with Tkinter.  The tutorial link I'm using is here:
